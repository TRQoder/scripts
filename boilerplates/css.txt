	// Place your snippets for css here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"css boilerplate": {
		"prefix": "* css boilerplate",
		"body": [
			"*{",
			"  margin: 0;",
			"  padding: 0;",
			"  box-sizing: border-box;",
			"}",
			"html, body{",
			"  height: 100%;",
			"  width: 100%;",
			"}",
			"$1"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	}
