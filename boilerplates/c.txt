	// Place your snippets for c here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	
	// Example:
	"boilerplate": {
		"prefix": "x boilerplate for c",
		"body": [
			"#include<stdio.h>\n",
			
			"int main(){",
			"\t$1\n\t\n\t",
			"\t return 0;",
			"}",
			"$2"
		],
		"description": "BoilerPlate for C"
	},

	"print": {
		"prefix": "xx",
		"body": [
			"printf(\"$1\\n\"$2);",
			
			
			"$0"
		],
		"description": "print function"
	},

	"scan": {
		"prefix": "z",
		"body": [
			"scanf(\"%$1\",&$2);",
			
			"$0"
		],
		"description": "scan function"
